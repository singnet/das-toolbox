    das-cli attention-broker stop - Stop the running Attention Broker service

SYNOPSIS

    das-cli attention-broker stop

DESCRIPTION

    Stops the currently running Attention Broker container. This halts the processing of messages
    and deactivates the broker until it is explicitly started again.

    If the service is already stopped, a warning message is displayed.

EXAMPLES

    Stop the running Attention Broker service:
